# 👋 Hi, I'm Sudeep

🎓 Electronics and Communication Engineering student with a strong interest in **Embedded Systems**, **Machine Learning**, **VLSI** and the intersection of the Embedded and ML: **TinyML**.

Currently focused on developing efficient, real-world ML solutions and exploring how AI/ML can be integrated into resource-constrained embedded platforms. I enjoy understanding the full workflow—from data preprocessing to model deployment.
